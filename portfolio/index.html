                    <h1 class="headings">AI</h1>
                    <p>AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to the field of computer science and technology that aims to create intelligent machines capable of simulating human intelligence and performing tasks that typically require human cognitive abilities. 
                        AI involves developing computer systems and algorithms that can perceive, reason, learn, and make decisions similar to how humans do.
                        AI has applications in various fields and industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, manufacturing, gaming, and cybersecurity. It has the potential to automate routine tasks, assist in decision-making, optimize processes, and unlock new opportunities for innovation and problem-solving.

                    <h1 class="headings">UX/UI</h1>
                    <p>UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface) are two distinct but closely related terms in the field of website and application design. 
                        While they are often used together, they refer to different aspects of the design process.

                        User Experience (UX) design focuses on creating a positive and meaningful experience for users when they interact with a website or application. 
                        It involves understanding the needs, behaviors, and goals of users and designing the overall flow and functionality of the product to meet those needs. 
                        UX designers conduct user research, create user personas, develop user journeys, and wireframe the structure and layout of the interface.</p>

                    <h1 class="headings">MI</h1>
                    <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. 
                        It is concerned with the development of algorithms that allow computers to automatically learn and improve from experience.
                        Machine learning has applications in various domains, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, medical diagnosis, autonomous vehicles, and many more.
                         It enables automation, improves decision-making processes, and uncovers valuable insights from large datasets.
